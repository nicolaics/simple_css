                        <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were 
                            built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese 
                            states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic 
                            groups from the Eurasian Steppe.</p>

                        <p>Christ The Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, 
                            Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian 
                            engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. 
                            Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. The statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, 
                            excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.</p>

                        <h3>Petra</h3>
                        <p>Petra is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. 
                            Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, 
                            Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. 
                            Access to the city is through a famously picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.</p>

                            just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, 
                            and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age.</p>

                        <h3>Chichén Itzá</h3>
                        <p>Chichén Itzá was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. 
                            The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. 
                            The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central 
                            Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. It was one of 
                            the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, 
                            or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.</p>

                        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the 
                            river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 
                            by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658) to house the tomb of 
                            his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 
                            The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a 
                            mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides 
                            by a crenellated wall.</p>
