            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>The New 7 Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2001 
                to choose Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments. 
                The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small amounts of telephone voting 
                was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation 
                (N7W) based in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, 
                at Est√°dio da Luz. The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was possible 
                for people to cast multiple votes. According to John Zogby, founder and current 
                President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling organization Zogby International, 
                New 7 Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".

                The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist 
                and tried to get more votes cast for it, while others downplayed or criticized the contest. 
                After supporting the New 7 Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign by providing 
                advice on nominee selection, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, 
                and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), bound by its bylaws to record and give equal status to 
                all World Heritage Sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again in 2007.
